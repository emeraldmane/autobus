Report 2
-----------

Part 1. To keep track of all the activities related to the development of your project, I am asking you to provide me with the following items:
-----------
1. An online/cloud link to your proposal
\ - see github
2. An online/cloud link to your GANTT diagram (some students have used teamgantt.com, but any other tool is welcome) including the Github task manager.
\ - see github
3. Website's URL if it is applicable.
\ - see github
4. Sharable Link to your GitHub repository
\
**Github https://github.com/loibucket/autobus/**
5. Any other resources we will need to access such as a youtube channel, etc? Please mention them here if it is applicable.

Part 2. Spend 10-20 minutes expounding on the following:
------------
1. What did you accomplish in the last week?
- Loi: Completed tutorials
- Philip: Finished tutorials
- Nate: Completed software setup, and ran all four tutorials.
- Nate: Researched further color and object detection for use in starting, stopping and speed control.
- Eric: Finished hardware setup, finished tutorials. 
- Yikun: Finished jetbot build and software setup. Completed tutorials - basic motion, teleoperation, collision avoidance, and object following.
- Yikun: Started data collection for road following features - a prototype of road following features in autobus implementation. Started training the collected dataset for test drives.

2. What roadblocks/issues did you face?
- Loi: Jetbot is very laggy and slow, by the time it processes the road or object images, the bot has already moved away.  The bot has to move very slow to respond to image recognition
- Philip: Camera issues, but this was resolved
- Nate: Replaced broken jetson nano board with new replacement board I ordered, and tested to ensure it worked.
- Nate: Issues with wifi connection setup, and also with software setup guide not being as straightforward as could have been.
- Nate: Missing chunks of code in Nvidia jetbot tutorial notebooks, which needed to be troubleshot to resolve.
- Eric: Issues with power supply; would be nice to have more training data for training better model. 
- Yikun: My bot's right motor was broken. I had to order another motor from Adafruit and reassemble the motor part in my bot. I also reorderd batteries.
- Yikun: The camera was laggy at first, so my collision avoidance was not performing well. I adjusted camera refresh rate and motor speed, and the images were able to catch up with the motion of the bot and I got better-than-expected results at the end.

3. What do you hope to accomplish in the coming week?
- Loi: Improve rail following stability, build image recognition to stop jetbot
- Nate: Video and submit finished tutorials of jetbot running them.
- Nate: Build ML model for color and object detection for use in starting, stopping and speed control.
- Eric: Build ML model, create and tag images for additional training to develop better models.  
- Yikun: Construct the road prototype at my home for test drive, and finalize road-following modules on blankets setup to simulate a bus scneario in desert regions.
- All: Work on final project documentation and presentation with the team.

4. What percentage of the project is done at the time of you submitting this report? ___75_______%

5. Submit a video (mp4) of the latest capabilities you can demonstrate for your project  for this week
