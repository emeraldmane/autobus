Part 2. Spend 10-20 minutes expounding on the following:
------------
1. What did you accomplish in the last week?
- Loi: Completed jetbot build
- Loi: Peformed some tutorials - basic motion, teleoperation, collision avoidance, road tracking
- Philip: Finished hardware setup, solved various issues with hardware
- Nate: Completed software setup, and ran all four tutorials.
- Nate: Researched further color and object detection for use in starting, stopping and speed control.
- Eric: assumbling jetbot build, hardware setup
- Yikun: Finalizing hardware setup. Researching on strong lighting conditions and object detection.

2. What roadblocks/issues did you face?
- Loi: I upgraded jetbot software and it broke all the tutorials, they would not run.  I had to install the original software again.
- Loi: The road following tutorial is very slow, the jetbot takes very long to udpate the camera, making it very time consuming to collect training data.  This issue is ongoing.
- Philip: The kit shipped with incorrect and non fitting parts, it took a while for new ones to be delivered
- Nate: My first jetson nano developer had non-functioning usb parts, so I ordered various parts to try and fix it.
- Nate: Issues with wifi connection setup, and also with software setup guide not being as straightforward as could have been.
- Nate: Missing chunks of code in Nvidia jetbot tutorial notebooks, which needed to be troubleshot to resolve.
- Eric: hardware parts issues was incorrect, had to order replacement power supply.
- Yikun: Nano screw to the system were not exact fit with the motor cover. Had to modify the equipments.

3. What do you hope to accomplish in the coming week?
- Loi: Complete the training data set based on road following demo, to use for the project
- Nate: Video and submit finished tutorials of jetbot running them.
- Nate: Build ML model for color and object detection for use in starting, stopping and speed control.
- Eric: implement sample route operation. 
- Yikun: Finish test tutorials, construct the road prototype for test drive, and research on vision modules.
- All: Work on final project documentation and presentation with the team.
