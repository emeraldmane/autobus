Part 2. Spend 10-20 minutes expounding on the following:
------------
1. What did you accomplish in the last week?
- Loi: Completed jetbot build
- Loi: Peformed some tutorials - basic motion, teleoperation, collision avoidance, road tracking
- Philip: Finished hardware setup, solved various issues with hardware
- Nate: Completed hardware setup, and started software setup.
- Nate: Began researching color and object detection for use in starting, stopping and speed control.

2. What roadblocks/issues did you face?
- Loi: I upgraded jetbot software and it broke all the tutorials, they would not run.  I had to install the original software again.
- Loi: The road following tutorial is very slow, the jetbot takes very long to udpate the camera, making it very time consuming to collect training data.  This issue is ongoing.
- Philip: The kit shipped with incorrect and non fitting parts, it took a while for new ones to be delivered
- Nate: My first jetson nano developer had non-functioning usb parts, so I ordered various parts to try and fix it.
- Nate: I was unable to work around the loss of usb port issues, so I ordered a new jetson nano developer kit.
- Nate: The jetson nano developer kit came damaged, so I had to return it. I am waiting on the new one to arrive tomorrow.

3. What do you hope to accomplish in the coming week?
- Complete the training data set based on road following demo, to use for the project
- Nate: Replace jetson nano developer kit with new one, and setup software for functionality.
- Nate: Run all nvidia examples to catch-up with Loi to start next steps.
- Nate: Begin coding out object and color detection models for use in starting, stopping and speed control.

4. What percentage of the project is done at the time of you submitting this report? ___10_______%
