# AutoBUS : Autonomous Basic Universal Shuttle / Virtual Rail System
2020 DGMDS17 Robotics, Autonomous Vehicles, Drones, and Artificial Intelligence @ Harvard University Extension School

Autonomous - level 5 no human involvement, besides an emergency stop button \
Basic - uses single camera, no complicated LIDARs or multiple camera systems \
Universal - non-proprietary, can be set up in any country, just paint some lines \
Shutte - carries people from point A to point B to point C

**1. Team Name: AutoBUS**

**2. Team Members and Roles:**\
Loi Cheng\
Philip Eisner\

Eric Ding

**3. Goal of the Project:** (Describe here which autonomous navigation challenge you want to solve: example: lane following with collision avoidance, solving intersections, April tags, follow an object, slam etc...)

A proof of concept autonomous virtual rail shuttle system with a NVIDIA waveshare jetbot.  The shuttle runs on dedicated paths, and follows visual "rail" lines, instead of actual steel rails.  The project would involve building a reliable lane following system that can be operated 24/7.  Special markers at stations is recognized by the shuttle to make automated stops and departures.  The shuttle should have frontal obstacle detection and can make emergency stops as needed.  Additional features like multiple routes, express/local shuttles, hub stations, may also be implemented

**4. Software and Developing tools:**

Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks, Python

a. include a GitHub repository

https://github.com/loibucket/autobus/

b. any other tools? (example: dropbox, google drive, slack, google collab, etc.)

**5. Hardware used:**

NVIDIA Jetson and Jetbot System with Camera

**6. Team Meeting Schedule: (tentative hours to meet with your team every week)**

As needed, otherwise use Slack
